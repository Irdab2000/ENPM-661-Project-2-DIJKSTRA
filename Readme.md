- The code works perfectly well. Please give significant time if you want to search for end-to-end coordinates.

- Steps to run the code:
    - In a folder, download both the obstacle_gen.py and Dijkstra,py files.
    - In a new terminal, run python3 Dijkstra.py

- In pygame, the window origin is the top left corner. I have adjusted this for the visualziation.
- When running Dijkstra.py, the program calculates the list of coordinates of free space and obstacles from obstacles_gen.py and it shows the map generated, initially. Please give the code 30 seconds for it to compute the lists and then, after the map is shown, the code will prompt the user to enter the start and goal cordinates.
